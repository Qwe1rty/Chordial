TODO LIST:

GENERAL:
- All kinds of logging
- Some form of environment variable/configuration handling

PERSISTENCE:
- Change PersistenceActor map to some form of cache
  - Ensure that the file stream is closed upon eviction
- Partitioning the key range to the different threads
- Allow for concurrent read access to the same key OR some type of manual caching
- Eliminate IORequest's dependence on the PersistenceActor companion object
- Be able to group the IOTasks together into a single chain of operations
- Replace .get calls for the pendingRequest: Option[ActorRef] in KeyStateActor
