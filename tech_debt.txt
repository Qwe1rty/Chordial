TODO LIST:

GENERAL:
- All kinds of logging
  - Formalize the "tag" pattern when making logs from a duplicate actor
- Some form of actual environment variable/configuration/dependency injection

SERVICE:
- Replace the ActorMaterializer instance with the system wide one
- Reorganize service layer so its initialization in Chordial.class matches the others
- Reorganize the templating of the different request types, so that RequestServiceActor isn't
  responsible for the different request types and their handling

PERSISTENCE:
- Change PersistenceActor map to some form of cache
  - Ensure that the file stream is closed upon eviction
- Allow for concurrent read access to the same key OR some type of manual caching
- Replace .get calls for the pendingRequest: Option[ActorRef] in KeyStateActor
- Formalize KeyStateActor to an actual state machine
