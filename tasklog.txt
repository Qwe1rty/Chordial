TODO LIST:

GENERAL:
- All kinds of logging
- Some form of environment variable/configuration handling

PERSISTENCE:
- Change PersistenceActor map to some form of cache
  - Ensure that the file stream is closed upon eviction
- Partitioning the key range to the different threads
- Try to isolate thread state between the persistence & key actors
